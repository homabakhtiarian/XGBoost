# XGBoost
It is a super powerful Machine Learning model. you will see that it brings excellent results in most Machine Learning problems.
It can be both used for regression and classification.
We are going to predict if a breast cancer tumor is benign or malignant, meaning that each row of this data set corresponds to a certain patient.
And for each of these patients, we have several features from the clump thickness, the uniformity of cell sized uniformity of cell shape and ... all these features that are characteristics of a tumor.
what we want to do is to build the XGBoost model and train it on this data set.
As for the performance measure, we have used k-fold cross validation.
